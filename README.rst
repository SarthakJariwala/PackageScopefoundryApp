Sample Scopefoundry App for Packaging
=====================================

Sample App written in python using `Scopefoundry`_ and PyQt5. 
This is a **sample** app meant to serve as template to **build and package** a 
Scopefoundry app into a **native application** using `Briefcase`_. 

Building and packaging will allow the user to **run and install the Scopfoundry app as a native application** 
and **not run it from the commandline/terminal**.

**This cross-platform app was generated by** `Briefcase`_ **- part of**
`The BeeWare Project`_. **If you want to see more tools like Briefcase, please
